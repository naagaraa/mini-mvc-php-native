> As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>
> -   Spelling / grammar fixes
> -   Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
> -   Comment clean up
> -   Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
> -   Adding logging messages or debugging output
> -   Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
